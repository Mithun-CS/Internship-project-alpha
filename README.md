## 💡 The Problem & Solution
Standard monitoring dashboards often rely on "polling" (refreshing every X seconds), which creates unnecessary server load and delayed insights. **Elite-Pulse** solves this by implementing a **Bi-Directional WebSocket Pipeline** using PostgreSQL Listen/Notify triggers.

### Key Engineering Achievements:
- **Sub-Second Latency:** Real-time UI updates triggered directly from database inserts via Supabase Realtime.
- **Secure Middleware Architecture:** Integrated Next.js Middleware with Supabase Auth to ensure zero-access to dashboard metrics without valid JWT credentials.
- **Hydration Guarding Pattern:** Solved complex SSR vs. CSR synchronization issues for responsive SVG data rendering.
- **Automated Pulse Simulation:** Engineered a background heartbeat service to simulate high-density metric traffic for testing environments.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Charts:** Recharts (SVG-optimized responsive containers)
- **Backend-as-a-Service:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Real-time Engine:** WebSockets & Broadcast channels
- **Deployment:** Vercel (CI/CD Pipeline)

## 🏗 System Architecture


1. **The Pulse:** A simulated or real hardware event inserts a row into the `sensors` table.
2. **The Trigger:** PostgreSQL identifies the change and broadcasts a notification.
3. **The Stream:** The client-side React hook listens to the WebSocket channel.
4. **The Render:** Recharts performs a smooth "monotone" interpolation to update the UI instantly.
